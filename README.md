# Coding Quiz

## Description

- The big idea behind this project is the concept of dynamically placing elements on the page using JavaScript.
- Utilizing Bootstrap to handle the styling allowed me to focus on the JavaScript logic for the functionality of the page.
- The quiz itself is not too hard, but is a fun challenge to keep certain knowledge fresh.

## Usage

- Depending on user action, the timer and score elements are updated in real time. If a correct answer is chosen, the score increases. If an incorrect answer is chosen, the timer decreases.
- The quiz can end if either the timer runs out or the user completes all questions.
